 I know I'm late to the party on this, but the Guardian has put together a   [great summary of the NSA revelations](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded)   to date. I'm forwarding this to all my family and friends who I've inarticulately tried to explain this to. 

 Incidentally , it's also a beautifully designed site.
