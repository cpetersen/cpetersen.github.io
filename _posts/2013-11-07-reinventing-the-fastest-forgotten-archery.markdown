This guy set out to relearn the long lost techniques of the "master archer". What he can do is incredible, like hitting 3 discs, that were thrown at the same time, with 3 different arrows, while walking backwards, in under 1.2 seconds. What's more interesting is that these techniques were lost and even modern archers thought that historical references, like Hiawatha being able to shoot 10 arrows into the air before the first hit the ground, were flat out impossible. 

 It's a shame the production quality isn't great, but it's definitely worth a watch. Approx 5 minutes.
