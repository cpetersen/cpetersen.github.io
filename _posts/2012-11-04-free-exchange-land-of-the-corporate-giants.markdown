Businesses have gotten bigger over the decades. The Economist asks, how long will these economies of scale hold up? Having worked with a number of very large firms, anecdotally I can say, there must be a size limit after which a company becomes less efficient, not more.

One way to answer this question is to estimate how output levels influence the costs of production in a competitive industry. This relationship—known as a “cost function”—can be tricky to establish because firms often have multiple inputs and outputs. Take farming. Estimating a cost function requires complex information on how each farm’s outputs (milk, meat and crops) and inputs (labour, energy, feed, capital) interact.
