 [Organovo](http://www.organovo.com)  is a company, based on the the very exciting idea of printing living tissue using 3D printers. Basically it would allow a doctor to print out veins or organs using your own tissue. I must admit, I never gave much thought to need to design these organs, but partnering with Autodesk to build that software is a great idea.

 [Assay Depot](http://www.assaydepot.com)  used to share an office with Organovo. Really a great bunch of people.

 > Autodesk’s software may be best-known for helping architects design buildings or for prototyping products, but it soon may be applied to designing tissues and organs.

 > Autodesk and [Organovo](http://www.organovo.com/) , a publicly-traded bioprinting company, are partnering on software for designing three-dimensional human tissues. While it’s still a few years too early for these tissues to be applied in treating humans, Organovo-printed tissues are already used in medical research.
