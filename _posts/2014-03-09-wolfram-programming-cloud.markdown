 You have to admire the audacity, a few months ago, Wolfram announces their own programming language, now they are announcing their own cloud to deploy it to. I must admit, over the top claims like the ones above turn me off a little, but I am intrigued. I like the idea of algorithmically based start ups, and this offering is aimed squarely at them. After all, it is billed as ideal for:

 * Algorithmic Startups
 * Rapid Algorithm Deployment

 I’m very interested to see what it can do.
