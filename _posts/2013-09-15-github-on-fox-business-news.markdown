Good on  [GitHub](https://github.com/)   It's great to see one of the companies/services that I love and use daily getting press. However, it's interesting to me how this looks to someone who isn't familiar with the Software Development world. They didn't cover how long they'd been in business, or that they were bootstrapped and profitable before taking the investment. To an outsider, how would you distinguish between  [GitHub](https://github.com/)  and say  [Medium](https://medium.com/)   which has no discernible business model as far as I can tell, or even  [Groupon](http://www.groupon.com/)  that has millions of users, but whose model is far more predatory.
