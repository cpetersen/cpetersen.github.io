I gave a talk at the [7CTOs](https://7ctos.com) Colloquium in Austin on best practices for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines—and how we're starting to see a clear architecture emerge for serious LLM-based applications.

In this talk, I cover:

* Chunking strategies (simple, structural, semantic)
* Search and retrieval (BM25, vector search, RRF)
* Query rewriting, decomposition, and HyDE
* Reranking, repacking, and summarization
* Tool calling and query classification

I also share prompts, techniques, and design tradeoffs we've discovered while building real-world LLM applications at [Scientist.com](https://www.scientist.com).

Thanks to 7CTOs for putting on the event and thank you to [Howdy.com](https://howdy.com) for hosting!
