A little philosophy from Jason Fried.

 > He said the mistakes weren’t intentional. *What was intentional was the desire not to go back and fix them.*

 > He said the Navajo saw mistakes as moments in time. And since you can’t change time, why try to change a mistake that already happened? The mistake is already woven into the fabric of time. It’s good to be reminded of it when you look back.
