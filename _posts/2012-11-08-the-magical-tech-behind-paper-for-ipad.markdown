 [Paper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812)  is a very well done app. I like the description of how they went the extra mile to make color selection natural. Spring for the mixer in-store purchase, if only to see their interface in action.

 > So why was it worth a year of development and brainstorming to fix this intractable color-mixing problem? The FiftyThree team says itâ€™s about giving your big features--in their case, the watercolor brush, the marker, the pencil--room to grow and improve. Without fixing the color dilemma, the rest of the app couldn't improve.
