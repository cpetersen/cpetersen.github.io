 [Impala](https://github.com/cloudera/impala)  looks like an interesting tool. I'm not sure when I'll have a chance to dig into it first hand.

 > A couple weeks ago Cloudera released [Impala](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/cloudera-impala-real-time-queries-in-apache-hadoop-for-real/) , with the promise of Hive like functionality with much lower latency. I decided to give Hadoop-based SQL -like technologies another shot.
 > 
 > We set up a couple of machines in a cluster, pulled together a few sample datasets, and ran a few benchmarks comparing Impala, Hive, and MySQL, and the results were encouraging for Impala.
