 Adobe has announced their  [cloud SDK](https://creativesdk.adobe.com)   It looks really interesting, you can pull layers from individual file/projects in the cloud. Edit them locally and save them back and they retain their full edit-ability. I canâ€™t wait to see what happens when you mix this with the new iOS integration, particularly the  [photo filtering and edit tools](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/photos/).
