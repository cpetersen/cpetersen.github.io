This post, from 2005, covers the dangers of "consultingware" (love that term). This trap is so easy to fall into, especially for startsup looking for  [product market fit](http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/)   and ESPECIALLY if you land that "big client". For that reason, it brings to mind  [Mark Suster's Elephant Hunting metaphor](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/16/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters/).

Or, if you're really lucky, the customer will smile wanly and put your code in a drawer and never use it again and never call you back.
