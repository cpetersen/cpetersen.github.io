 > Do work and get paid once. Build an asset and get paid for as long as it lasts.

 This is the salient difference between a product business and a consulting business. It's the reason that successful product businesses are valued at higher multiples than consulting businesses. It's also why product companies are so damn hard.

It's amazing how often people try to pull you back into the service mindset. Everytime I hear someone say "can't you just add" or "I'd use it if it only had", I say to myself, this person wants a consultant.
