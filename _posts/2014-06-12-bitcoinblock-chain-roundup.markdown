 Some interesting news in the Bitcoin and Block Chain world.  

 From the educational perspective, Ilya Grigorik covers the basics of how the block chain works in his excellent piece,  [Minimum Viable Block Chain](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/). Also  [@zach-bitcoin](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin)  released  [BasicCoin ](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/basiccoin) which is “the smallest [crypto-]currency” he could make, written in Python. 

 From the business perspective,  [Chain](https://chain.com)  has launched, which bills itself as “The Block Chain API for Developers” (looks really nice BTW). And finally, more recently, Expedia has announced that it will now  [accept Bitcoin for hotel reservations](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/11/expedia-starts-accepting-bitcoin-for-hotel-bookings/). 

 Lots happening the the world of Bitcoin and the broader world of the Block Chain.
