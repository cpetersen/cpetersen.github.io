I realize that  [most software projects fail in some way, shape or form](http://www.galorath.com/wp/software-project-failure-costs-billions-better-estimation-planning-can-help.php) , but this sounds like a particularly terrible failure.

 > IT projects are easy scapegoats for organizational failures. There's no way to know if Romney could have made up the margins in Ohio if Orca had worked. But the catastrophic failure of the system, purchased at large expense, squandered the campaign's most valuable resource—people—and was symptomatic of a much bigger leadership problem.
