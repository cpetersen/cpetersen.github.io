 I've thought Bioprinting was a great idea ever since I heard about it from  [Organovo](http://www.organovo.com/). Now it seems some hackers are bringing bioprinting to the DIY movement. It's amazing how fast these hi-tech machines are getting translated into something that anyone can own and use. 

 According to Wired, here are some of the possible uses for a bioprinter: 

 > 
 >  * Print gradients of nutrients and/or antibiotics on a layer of cells to study combinatorial interactions â€” or even to select different isolates from an environmental sample.
 >  * Print patterns of growth factors on a layer of eukaryotic cells to study cell differentiation.
 >  * Print two or more microbial species at different distances from each other, to study metabolic interactions.
 >  * Set up a computational problem as a 2-D pattern of engineered microbes on an agar plate.
 >  * Study  [Reaction-Diffusion systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system).
 >  * Print 3-D structures by over-printing layers using the inkjet head. Now you can consider doing all the above in 3-D!
 >  * Print cell in a sodium alginate solution, onto a surface soaked in calcium chloride, to build up 3D gel structures (similar to  [spherification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherification)  process in  [Molecular Gastronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_gastronomy) )
