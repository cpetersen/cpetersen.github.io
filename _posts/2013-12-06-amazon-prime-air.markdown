 Like everyone else on the internet, I love that Amazon is experimenting with drones. I believe drones have bright future in commercial use. There are a ton of technical hurdles to overcome, but I like  [Kevin Roose's take on it](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/12/amazon-drones-and-pre-lobbying.html) : 

 > By unveiling a huge drone program in progress, he’s sending a message to the FAA regulators and Senate committees who are currently considering how unmanned aircraft can be used commercially. And that message is: Don’t even think about getting in our way.
