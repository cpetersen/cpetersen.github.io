 Lucas Films shows us real time rendering (  [ï»¿click through for the video](http://www.thatvideosite.com/v/11118/lucasfilm-shows-off-the-future-of-filmmaking-scenes-get-rendered-out-in-real-time-removing-the-need-for-post-production)  ). Actors are walking around an environment wearing special suits, and their actions are being rendered in real time on the screen. The implications for movies are obvious, but there's got to be other uses for this. Think of video games, or imagine a laser tag or paint ball environment, where you took home an after action movie of your match set in the Star Wars or Avatar universe. You could throw a party for your kid, and send all the kids home with a video of them rendered as Ewoks.  

 Those are trivial examples, but I could see this working it's way into a lot of applications. It's kind of   [augmented reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)   in reverse, a kind of augmented virtual reality.
