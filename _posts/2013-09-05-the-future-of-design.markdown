Elon Musk shows us some visualization techniques they've been playing with at  [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/). They're using  [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/)  to interact with CAD models and various display technologies, including the  [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/) , to display it. Of course in the end, it's printed on a 3d printer. Cool!
