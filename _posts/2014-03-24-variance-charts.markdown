  [Variance](https://variancecharts.com)  looks like a really nice Javascript charting library. A little more flexibility than most JS charting libraries, but still done client side (as opposed to something like  [R](http://www.r-project.org) ). Maybe a middle ground between  [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/)  and  [D3](http://d3js.org)?
