 [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com)  is a wifi client in an SD card form factor. If you want to add wifi to your hardware project, this might be a convenient and inexpensive way to do it (they plan to retail for $25). What's more is, you configure it by having your phone flash a series of lights at it (using their app), so there's no need for an interface.

I learned about this because it looks like  [Lockitron](https://lockitron.com)   [is going to use it](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/lockitron-wifi-electric-imp/)  for their smartphone doorlock system. Very cool technology, but you are basically exposing your frontdoor to potential hacking. I'm interested to see what security features Lockitron implements.
