People really don't understand statistics.  [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com)  is one of the best informed blogs out there (in my opinion). In this article the Washington Post covers some of the people attacking it.

 > But it’s just as important to be clear about this: If Mitt Romney wins on election day, it doesn’t mean Silver’s model was wrong. After all, the model has been fluctuating between giving Romney a 25 percent and 40 percent chance of winning the election. That’s a pretty good chance! If you told me I had a 35 percent chance of winning a million dollars tomorrow, I’d be excited. And if I won the money, I wouldn’t turn around and tell you your information was wrong. I’d still have no evidence I’d ever had anything more than a 35 percent chance.
