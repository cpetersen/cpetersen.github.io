This is pretty cool.  [Euclideon](http://www.euclideon.com)  as a 3D search algorithm that can render “unlimited” amounts of point cloud data. Looks like a huge improvement over the current state of the art. I’m curious about the scanning technology. How long until you can create these point clouds from a car based system (Google Street View) or from your phone?
