Forbes collected some predictions about technologies impact on health care, here's mine:

 >
 >
 > **Lives Will Be Improved With Elimination Of Diseases**
 >
 > As an optimist, I like to think tech’s recent interest in health care stems from a genuine desire to improve the human condition while seeing it as a massive investment opportunity secondarily. Tech’s involvement could improve the lives of millions of people around the world by better systematizing health records, automating patient care and eradicating incurable and rare diseases.
