 [Moodstocks](http://www.moodstocks.com)  provides a free iOS library for recognizing objects using the camera on your iPhone. Looks pretty amazing, but it also looks like you have to upload images of the objects you want to recognize to their server ahead of time. Still pretty cool, but not quite as mind blowing as the demo makes it look. They've just published a  [sample app](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-rubymotion-demo-app)  written for  [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com).
