It's been said over and over again, pick your favorite quote:

 * "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — Leonardo da Vinci 
 * "A modern paradox is that it’s simpler to create complex interfaces because it’s so complex to simplify them." — Pär Almqvist 
 * "Most people just make the mistake that it should be simple to design simple things. In reality, the effort required to design something is inversely proportional to the simplicity of the result." — Roy Fielding 
 * "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system." — Gall's Law 

It's said over and over, because it needs to be.
