If you've run a web site, web service or web app, you know you need a status page and for obvious reasons, it needs to be hosted separate from your main site. I've always used  [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com)  to generate that page. While not exactly an alternative,  [StatusPage.io](https://www.statuspage.io)  looks like a good addition to that setup.
