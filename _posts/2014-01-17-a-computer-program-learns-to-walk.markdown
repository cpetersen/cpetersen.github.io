I thought, "Neat! It learned how to kangaroo hop!" then I thought, "Why are they throwing boxes at that fat man?!‚Äù  

 This really is cool, these SIGGRAPH presenters created a program that learns to walk and can do so in various environments and with different physiologies. So you can see how a Kangaroo learns how to walk on Earth, or how a Raptor would walk on Jupiter. The model is very comprehensive, including things like neural delay and a musculature model.
