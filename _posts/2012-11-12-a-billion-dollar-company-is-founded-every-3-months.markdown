I find it interesting that the number of Billion dollar companies founded, stays relatively constant (excluding 2002), despite some years clearly having a lot more startups than others. I wonder what this says about the demand for tech startups.

Put another way, if 10 of these companies were all started in the same year, would they all be Billion dollar companies now?
