I recently joined Robbie Matthews and Vincent A. Alessi on [The Bits in Bio Podcast](https://www.bitsinbio.org) to talk about nearly 20 years of building Scientist.com—from running a CRO lab to creating a B2E marketplace that's facilitated $2.5 billion in pharma R&D procurement.

We covered a lot of ground: pivotal business and architecture decisions, deploying AI across workflows for nearly all top 30 pharma companies, our recent acquisition by GHO Capital Partners, and a few hard-earned lessons along the way.

I also shared one of my favorite early stories—a legendary Paul Blart Mall Cop rescue that happened in the early days of the company. You'll have to listen to get the full story.

If you're anywhere near the intersection of technology and biotech, give it a listen. Robbie and Vince host a great show.
