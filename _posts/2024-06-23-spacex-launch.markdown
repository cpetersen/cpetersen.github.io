SpaceX has launched a number of rockets out of Vandenberg in the evenings recently. When they launch from Vandenberg they head south over the Pacific. Launches in the evening are particularly visible because the sun is low, but it's still light out. I took the kids out to see them.

The launch on the 23rd was partially obscured by cloud cover, but the effect looked pretty cool.
