I've been saying this to Dana for years. I think it started just about the time I helped found  [Assay Depot](http://www.assaydepot.com).

 > The Agenda has often wondered if [decoupling](http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/jon-stewart-proposes-an-entrepreneurial-policy-dont-laugh/boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/on-health-care-readers-speak-the-agenda-responds/) health insurance from employment might encourage entrepreneurship. But Mr. Stewart is pushing a bigger idea here of a wide safety net for failure, and an associated trade-off between diminished risks and a diminished reward (presumably reduced by the higher taxes necessary to subsidize those risks). And perhaps one reason nobody has been able to sell that idea is because we’ve never heard anyone advance it in the public square before.
