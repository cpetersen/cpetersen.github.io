I've been saying this to Dana for years. I think it started just about the time I helped found  [Assay Depot](http://www.assaydepot.com).

 > The Agenda has often wondered if [decoupling](http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/jon-stewart-proposes-an-entrepreneurial-policy-dont-laugh/boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/on-health-care-readers-speak-the-agenda-responds/) health insurance from employment might encourage entrepreneurship. But Mr. Stewart is pushing a bigger idea here of a wide safety net for failure, and an associated trade-off between diminished risks and a diminished reward (presumably reduced by the higher taxes necessary to subsidize those risks). And perhaps one reason nobody has been able to sell that idea is because weâ€™ve never heard anyone advance it in the public square before.
