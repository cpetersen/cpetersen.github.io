 Eric Hunsader, a  veteran programmer,  explains to the Washington Post the actual mechanics of front running (or  [predatory trading](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/fervent_defense_of_frontrunning_hfts.html)  depending on who you talk to). I’ll admit, that HFT is a complicated issue that’s likely not all good or all bad. However, if the scenario that Eric describes is actually happening, that sounds pretty all bad to me.
