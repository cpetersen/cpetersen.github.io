 >  1. Development speed is everything.
 >  1. Minimize complexity. The simpler the product, the more likely you are to actually ship it, and the more likely you are to fix problems quickly.
 >  1. Pick implementations that give 80% of the benefit with 20% of the work.
 >  1. Use off the shelf components whenever possible.
 >  1. Use development sprints. Make sure your sprints aren’t longer than one or two weeks.
 >  1. Beware of long projects. If you can’t fit it into a sprint, don’t build it.
 >  1. Beware of long rewrites. If you can’t fit it into a sprint, don’t do it.
 >  1. If you must do something that doesn’t fit into a sprint, put as much structure and peer review around it as possible.
 >  1. Working on the wrong thing for a month is equivalent to not showing up to work for a month at all.
