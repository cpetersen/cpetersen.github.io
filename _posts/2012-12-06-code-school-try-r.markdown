I'm excited to learn R and  [this program](http://tryr.codeschool.com)  from  [code school](http://www.codeschool.com)  looks like a great way to start.

 > R is a tool for statistics and data modeling. The R programming language is elegant, versatile, and has a highly expressive syntax designed around working with data. R is more than that, though â€” it also includes extremely powerful graphics capabilities. If you want to easily manipulate your data and present it in compelling ways, R is the tool for you.
