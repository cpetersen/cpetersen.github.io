 [ember-tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools)  could be big. I've been itching to try out  [ember.js](http://emberjs.com)  for rich client-side web apps, but haven't yet. This really lowers the bar. I'd love to see how this integrates with  [rails-api](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api).
