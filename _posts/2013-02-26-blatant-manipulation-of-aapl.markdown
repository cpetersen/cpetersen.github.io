 This is really disgusting, hedge fund manager spreads a completely unverifiable rumor,  [on twitter](https://twitter.com/DougKass/statuses/306475843784425472)  nonetheless, and profits from the result. Some choice quotes from the article: 

 >  What’s important when you’re in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. 

 And 

 >  Who cares about the fundamentals? 

 And finally:  

 >  "This is actually blatantly illegal,” he added, “but when you have six days and your company may be in doubt because you are down, I think it is really important to foment."
