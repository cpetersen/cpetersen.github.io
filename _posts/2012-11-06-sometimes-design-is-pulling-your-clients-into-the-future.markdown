I like this description of a designer. I'd say it applies to developers and entrepreneurs as well.

 > ### Designers: Unsatisfied and Optimistic

 > Designers hold two opposing thoughts in their mind at the same time: you are at once unsatisfied with how things are *and* optimistic about the future. That’s an odd combination if you think about it. Most optimistic people are not unsatisfied…and most unsatisfied people are not optimistic. Holding those two ideas in the mind at the same time is not easy…it can be a manic ride. Wow…that totally sucks! Ugh…devastated. But WAIT…what if it were like THIS! That would be awesome…let’s go build it!
