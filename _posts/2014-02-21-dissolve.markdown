Dissolve looks pretty cool. They sell royalty free video clips. Basically b-roll if you are putting together your next product video. I clicked around, it looks like a significant portion of their catalog is available for a few bucks, with some videos ranging up to $150 (and probably higher). I nice resource to know about.
