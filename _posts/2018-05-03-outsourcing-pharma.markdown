Outsourcing Pharma covered the launch of our Data Integrity Initiative, which is part of our broader Data Smart program.

 >
 > Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies use blockchain to prove that transactions are valid and occurred at a specific time, even in an environment where participants are not incentivized to help one another. That's the breakthrough that makes cryptocurrencies possible. We've applied that same technology to prove the existence of data collected at a specific point in time, which has not been altered since, nor can be altered in the future.
