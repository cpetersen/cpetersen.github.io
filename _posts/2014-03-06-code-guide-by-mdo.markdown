 > Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.

 When  [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)  talks about coding standards, we’d do well to listen. Here is his HTML and CSS coding standard. There is a lot of great advice in here, including things I never even though about, like standardizing the order in which HTML attributes appear within tags. 

 So who’s going to write the  [GitHub ](https://github.com) bot that sends pull requests with these changes?
