 I'm fascinated by how language can affect how we think. This infographic shows 12 emotions for which english doesn't have a word.

Vaguely reminiscent of the " [Eskimos have 100 words for snow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow) " legend... but real.

 > Few of us use all--or even most--of the 3,000 English-language words available to us for describing our emotions, but even if we did, most of us would still experience feelings for which there are, apparently, no words.
 > 
 > In some cases, though, words do exist to describe those nameless emotions--they're just not English words. Which is a shame, because--as today's infographic by design student [Pei-Ying Lin](http://peiyinglin.net/about/) demonstrates, they often define a feeling entirely familiar to us.
