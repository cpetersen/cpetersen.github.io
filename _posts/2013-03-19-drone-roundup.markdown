There were a couple good articles about drones in the last day or two. This  [one](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/04/12/what-is-a-drone-anyway/)  from Scientific American asks, "What is a drone exactly?" 

 >  What, exactly, is a drone?

 > The answer turns out to be more complex than might be expected. Strictly speaking, a drone is an unmanned aircraft that can fly autonomously—that is, without a human in control. But even that seemingly simple definition quickly runs up against the nuances of how contemporary unmanned aircraft are flown. 

 And this  [one](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/business/domestic-drones-on-patrol.html) , from the NY Times, looks at some of the possibilities and concerns that drones are generating. 

 >  “The sky’s going to be dark with these things,” said Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired, who started the hobbyist Web site   [DIY Drones](http://diydrones.com/)   and now runs a company, 3D Robotics, that sells unmanned aerial vehicles and equipment. He says it is selling about as many drones every calendar quarter — about 7,500 — as the United States military flies in total. 

 I know Chris Anderson wants to sell a lot of drones, but that quote is a little creepy.
