Fucking Congress. So they finally agree on one thing... and this is what they decide it should be?

Ron Wyden (D-OR) was shot down. Of the 23 opponents, 20 were Democrats and 3 were Republicans.

 > Wyden's amendment would have applied a bare modicum of transparency to the FISA Amendments Act, which allows the government to intercept international communications of Americans without a warrant. The defeated amendment would have required reports to Congress about whether any wholly domestic communications were picked up by NSA wiretapping.
