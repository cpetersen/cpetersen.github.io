  [Mattermark](http://mattermark.com)  gives users information about private companies. I’m not sure how they get the information, but I may sign up for the free trial just to see what they have. I wonder if it is specific to Silicon Valley tech start ups or if they have information on San Diego Biotech… for instance.
