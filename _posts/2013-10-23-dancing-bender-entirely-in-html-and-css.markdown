 This dancing Bender was created entirely using HTML5 and CSS3. No javascript at all. Actually what you see above is an animated gif, click through for  [the actual HTML+CSS version](http://liveweave.com/RJPtIu). 

 This seems like a good time to remind everyone that HTML5 + CSS3 is actually  [Turing complete](http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/articles/accidentally_turing_complete.html).
