Just in time for the  [largest protest against mass surveillance](https://rally.stopwatching.us/)    [StopWatching.Us](https://optin.stopwatching.us/)  has released a video explaining what it is and why it's important that we stop it now. 

 I'm really impressed with the production value of the video. I know that shouldn't matter, but it does. 

 After you watch the video consider signing the  [petition](https://optin.stopwatching.us/)  and while you're at it, go donate to  [Ladar](https://rally.org/lavabit).
