This is the flip-side of Marc Adreesen's " [Software is Eating the World](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html) ". Interesting distinction, is software eating the world, or is the world eating software?

 > When I look at what excites me, I see a much bigger world than just software. I’ve already argued that [biology is in the process of exploding](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/10/biohacking.html) , and the biological revolution could be even bigger than the computer revolution. I’m increasingly interested in hardware and gadgetry, which I used to ignore almost completely. And we’re following the “Internet of Things” (and in particular, the [“Internet of Very Big Things”](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/10/investigating-the-industrial-internet.html) ) very closely. I’m not saying that software is irrelevant or uninteresting. I firmly believe that software will be a component of every (well, almost every) important new technology. But what grabs me these days isn’t software as a thing in itself, but software as a component of some larger system. The software may be what makes it work, but it’s not about the software.
