 > We captured more than  __100,000 public comments__  on porn and sexually-oriented websites in which  __users left their mobile phone number__  to male/female/transgender performers,  __where everyone could see it__ , and we turned them into  __a series of paintings which you can purchase__.

 This website is a funny and scary at the same time. On the one hand, they are basically extorting money from people. On the other hand, who in their right mind puts their phone number in a publicly accessible comment any where, let alone a porn site?
