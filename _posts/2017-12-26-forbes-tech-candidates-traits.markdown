I told Forbes that *curiosity* is the most important trait to look for when evaluating new hires for technology based positions.

 > **Curiosity**

 > When debugging an issue, curiosity means asking “why” a few more times than the next person. When innovating, it means a broader range of interests to draw from. Curiosity within technology is great, but I'm really looking for curiosity in the most general sense. Curious people are natural learners and, this may be selfish, but I just like being around them.
