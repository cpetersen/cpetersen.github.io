 Good simple advice from Jeff Atwood regarding To Do Lists. Don’t get me wrong, I use Wunderlist and I’ve been a Things user, but I use them to keep track of actual lists, like things I need to get at the grocery store. I have a similar relationship with Ticket Tracking systems. They are great for bugs, if your site is throwing an error, great, needs to be in the ticket system. But as soon as that ticket system ventures into the realm of features or wish lists, it’s time to throw it away and start fresh. You should keep the three features that you, or your team, are working on in your head. Worry about the next feature when these are done. You’ll make better decisions that way.
