When you're mocking up a website, sometimes you just need an image of a particular size, these are called placeholder images. Who knew there was so many sites devoted to them?

 Still too timid? Want something bolder for your mockups? What about Nicolas Cage? (via  [http://www.placecage.com](http://www.placecage.com/) )
