An oldie but a goodie.  [Coda Hale](http://codahale.com)  gives a tech talk at  [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com)  about his library,  [metrics](http://metrics.codahale.com) , and measuring what your code does in production. In fact, this one of my favorite tech talks ever. Highly recommended, approximately 47 min.
