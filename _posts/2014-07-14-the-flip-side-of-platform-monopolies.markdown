 Fred Wilson has a piece on platform monopolies. It’s a good piece and you should read it. He ends it with: 

 >  So, as an investor, when you see a dominant market power emerge, you should start asking yourself “what will undo that market power?” And you should start investing in that. We’ve begun doing that, but are not anywhere near done with this effort. 

 It boils down to your basic contrarian advice, similar to: 

 >  When there's blood in the streets, buy property 

 or Warren Buffett’s: 

 >  You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus. 

 However, it’s more instructive since he’s talking about a class of investments. It gives you good places to go looking. 

I should point out, that while Fred is talking about monetary investments. It also applies to investments of your time and attention.
