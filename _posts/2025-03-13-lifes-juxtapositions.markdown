I love life's little juxtapositions. Like working with a language model on my MacBook, then cooking on my cast iron skillet. It's the modern and the old.

I was reminded of this a few weeks back. I was camping with my son in Jamul. We were in the desert, in a valley, with absolutely no cell service. It was a beautiful place. I left there, drove home, unpacked, showered, repacked and immediately got on a plane to San Francisco where I took a driverless Waymo to my meetings. It's kind of whiplash inducing, but it's also a wonderful juxtaposition.
