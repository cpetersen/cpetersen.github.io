 > BioBlender is a software package built on the open-source 3D modeling software Blender.
 > 
 > Biology works at nanoscale, with objects invisible to the human eye. With BioBlender it is possible to show some of the characters that populate our cells, based on scientific data and the highest standard of 3D manipulation. Scientists all over the world study proteins at atomic level and deposit information in the public repository Protein Data Bank, where each molecule is described as the list of its atoms and their 3D coordinates.

 I love to see existing open source projects repurposed like this.
