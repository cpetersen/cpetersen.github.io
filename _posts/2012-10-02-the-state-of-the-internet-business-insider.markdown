 This presentation is very well done.

***

![Connected Device Growth](/assets/import/4b3d667ff62780184146b58d82b4d70a.jpg) A major media company was kind enough to ask me to speak to their senior executives at an off-site last week.

The topic was an overview of the digital industry.

Analyst Alex Cocotas from our [BI Intelligence](https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/welcome?utm_source=House&utm_medium=Edit&utm_term=SOTU&utm_content=link&utm_campaign=BIIMobile) team helped me put together an excellent deck, using slides from the [BI Intelligence](https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/welcome?utm_source=House&utm_medium=Edit&utm_term=SOTU&utm_content=link&utm_campaign=BIIMobile) archive.

We've posted the deck here. We hope you enjoy it.
