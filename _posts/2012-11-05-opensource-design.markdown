The maker movement is so cool. I really think the next big thing is scalable manufacturing. The ability to build 1 or 2 of something, then scale that design up to thousands or millions in a straight foward manner.

 > Designers are beginning to go “open source”, allowing users to download tweakable templates for everyday objects like furniture. “Ship information not stuff!” declares the website for [AtFab](http://www.filson-rohrbacher.com/atfab.html) , which is spearheading the trend along with [SketchChair](http://www.sketchchair.cc/) and [MakeMe](http://make-me.com). Both AtFab and SketchChair specialise in homewares that can be put together from flat interlocking pieces of wood or acrylic. They are cut from a digital file by a laser-cutter or a computer numerical control (CNC) mill—machines which are becoming increasingly cheap and common. SketchChair also offers software that lets you draw-on components like legs, and test the physics of the chair against a manikin sized to the proportions of your body.

 > “The idea of a ‘factory’ is, in a word, changing,” writes Chris Anderson, a journalist and entrepreneur, in his [new book](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414742-makers) , “Makers: The New Industrial Revolution”. “Just as the Web democratised innovation in bits, a new class of ‘rapid prototyping’ technologies, from 3-D printers to laser cutters, is democratising innovation in atoms.” Mr Anderson is an advocate of the [“maker” movement](http://www.economist.com/node/21540392/) , a community that champions the digital and the do-it-yourself. He believes that mass customisation could re-energise manufacturing, create environmentally responsible jobs, and empower consumers to surround themselves with objects uniquely tailored to their needs.
