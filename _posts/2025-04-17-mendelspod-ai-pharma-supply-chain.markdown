I joined the [Mendelspod](https://www.mendelspod.com) podcast to discuss how artificial intelligence is transforming the research services marketplace and pharmaceutical infrastructure.

[Listen to the episode here.](https://www.mendelspod.com/p/ais-quiet-revolution-in-the-pharma)

In this episode, we cover:

* How AI is still in the "tinkering phase" compared to early web development
* Productivity gains across software development, negotiations, and customer service
* Elisa, our internal AI tool that functions like a fine-tuned ChatGPT within Slack
* Risks of AI consolidation and data concentration among a few large models
* Benchmate, our proprietary effort building internal LLMs using models like Mistral and DeepSeek
* AI's potential to reshape how science is organized and conducted

There are all of these problems that were impossible to solve a year and a half ago. And now you can solve them.
