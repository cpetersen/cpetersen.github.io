If youâ€™ve ever needed to glue  [Styrofoam to Glass](http://thistothat.com/cgi-bin/glue.cgi?lang=en&this=Glass&that=Styrofoam) , or  [Vinyl to Ceramic](http://thistothat.com/cgi-bin/glue.cgi?lang=en&this=Vinyl&that=Ceramic) , this is the site for you.  [ThisToThat.com](http://thistothat.com)  is about as simple (and effective) as you get. It presents you with two drop downs, you chose the two materials that you want to glue together, and it tells you what type of adhesive to use. 

 It probably took me longer to explain it than it would take for you to  [try it](http://thistothat.com/cgi-bin/glue.cgi?lang=en&this=Wood&that=Fabric).
