Staples will soon offer in-store 3d printing. I hope this is a long term strategy. It seems to me that we're still in a "dot-matrix" days of 3d printing, so I hope they stick with this regardless of short term performance.

 > A new service called “Staples Easy 3D” will allow customers to upload their designs to Staples’ website, then pick up the printed objects at their local office supply megastore, or have them shipped to their home or business — not unlike the photo- and document-printing service the company already offers.
