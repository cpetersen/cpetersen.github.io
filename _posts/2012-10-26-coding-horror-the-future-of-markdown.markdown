I've grown to love Markdown as well. We originally chose Textile at the  [Assay Depot](http://www.assaydepot.com) , but I think we'll be changing everything over the Markdown in the near future.

 > You can think of Markdown as a radically simplified and far more human readable form of HTML. __I have grown to love Markdown over the last few years.__ If you're a programmer of any shape, size, or color, you can't really *avoid* using Markdown, as it's central to both GitHub and Stack Overflow. For that matter, my new project uses Markdown, too.
