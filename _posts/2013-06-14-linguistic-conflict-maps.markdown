 My lovely wife sent me  [this one](http://www.businessinsider.com/22-maps-that-show-the-deepest-linguistic-conflicts-in-america-2013-6?op=1)   Business Insider has a series of maps depicting how different areas of the country pronounce different words. One of my favorites is "pecan pie". Obviously, it's "pick-AHN", but apparently I'm in the minority. Plus, I've never lived in any of the areas associated with that pronunciation. Actually, that may call into question their accuracy... but it's interesting nonetheless.
