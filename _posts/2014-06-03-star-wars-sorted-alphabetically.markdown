This guy wrote software that allowed him to manually tag every word in the original Star Wars movie. He then sorted the video clips alphabetically and merged them into a movie. There is 43 minutes of english dialog, so the video is 43 minutes long. Additionally, according to the creator, the word lightsaber appears only once in the film. Very weird, but very creative.
