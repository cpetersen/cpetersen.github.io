Great observation from Jeff Bezos.

 > He said people who were right a lot of the time *were people who often changed their minds.* He doesn’t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It’s perfectly healthy — encouraged, even — to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.
