A short version of [@sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers) TED talk about goals.

Your brain can mistake talking about your goals as accomplishing your goals, so if you want to accomplish something, resist telling people about it.

I've definitely experienced this myself. Note, this is different from "stealth mode". Getting your idea in front of people is not the same as sharing your goal.
