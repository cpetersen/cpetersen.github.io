This is an interesting way to make interfaces more immersive. They use a device to blow vortexes of air at users to create tactile feedback for on screen activities. Imagine "feeling" the ball you just swatted on screen with your Wii, or feeling the image you just swiped on your iPad. Obviously, this is pretty far from a commercial application, but it's a neat idea.
