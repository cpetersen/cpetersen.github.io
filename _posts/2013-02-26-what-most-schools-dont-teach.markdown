I really like this video, it many ways it reflects how I felt when I learned to code. Some of my favorite parts:

 * You don't need to be a genius to code, do you need to be a genius to read?
 * You don't need to go into coding wanting to learn the entirety of computer science, just start with something small that you want for yourself.
 * It's like playing a sport. It can be intimidating when you watch professional, but you can and should start small.
 * The first time I wrote "hello world" and made a computer print that out was mind-blowing. 
 They probably could have left out the bit in the middle about the nice offices with meals, dry cleaning and scooters... no one should get into programming because of free dry-cleaning.
