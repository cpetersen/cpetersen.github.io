A very interesting and detailed presentation from Mary Meeker of Kleiner Perkins about the macro trends that are happening on the internet. 

 I like the "Asset Heavy" to "Asset Light" transition they talk about starting on slide 59. 

 I also learned about a few new companies.  [Quirky](http://www.quirky.com)  and  [Waze](http://www.waze.com)  seem particularly interesting.
