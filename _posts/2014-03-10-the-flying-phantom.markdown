 A new catamaran design that allows the boat to raise it’s hulls a few feet out of the water on two hydrofoils. This reduces drag meaning the boat is not only dramatically faster, but also dramatically smoother in the water. I’m not exactly in the market for a boat, it just looks like a cool design. 

 To be fair, this design has been around for a while, but this is the first time it’s “affordable” coming in a $40k boat.
