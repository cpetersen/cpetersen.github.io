<p>Literally thousands of you have requested a visual timeline for <a href="http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/">The Pixar Theory</a>, so I put this together for you in an attempt to better organize my insane, hyperactive mind. <!--more--></p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not the full theory. There is plenty I don&#8217;t go over and there are many missing connections between movies I don&#8217;t bring up, so consult the full theory here if you want the details: <a href="http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/" rel="nofollow">http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

  [The unified theory of Pixar﻿](http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/15/the-pixar-theory-timeline/). Someone took the time to develop a theory that links all Pixar movies together. It would be awesome if this was intentional on Pixar's part, but still pretty cool if it was after the fact (or even coincidental). 

 This has all happened before and it will all happen again.
