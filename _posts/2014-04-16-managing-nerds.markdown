 > Nerds aren’t typically bitter; they’re just well informed. Snark from nerds is a leading indicator that I’m wasting their time and when I find it, I ask questions until I understand the inefficiency so I can change it or explain it.

 This is a great post, but I love the section on the bitter nerd. My only problem with this post is, I have trouble figuring out if I’m the nerd or the manager.
