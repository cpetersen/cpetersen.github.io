Kind of a dumb, but fun little article. I like the last one: "Ownership is the smorgasbord of insecurity."

 >  __Ownership is the smorgasbord of insecurity.__ I worry about sales. I worry about costs. I worry about facilities and employees and vendors and customers andâ€¦ you name it, I worry about it.
