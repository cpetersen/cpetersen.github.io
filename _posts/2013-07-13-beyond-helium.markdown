Solid blimps made out of Aerographite that never need to land, Neat idea that I never would have thought of.

 >  I can envisage airships that don’t use hydrogen or helium but use a “solid” tank of aerographite, meaning there would be no risk of explosions from the flammable hydrogen and lower risk of bursting the blimp. Also, you would not need to refill the blimp with hydrogen/helium leading to greater long term efficiency and potential applications that don’t require landing (e.g. surface imaging).
