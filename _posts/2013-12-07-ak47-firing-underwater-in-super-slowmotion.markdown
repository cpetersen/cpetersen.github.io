Fascinating video of a AK-47 firing underwater. You can probably skip the first 2 minutes of the video. The bubbles created by the bullet actually oscillate and look pretty cool. He tells us that this is described by the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (at about the 6:10 mark). It's worth a watch. (Approx. 10 min)
