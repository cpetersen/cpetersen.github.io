Drone has become just an all encompassing term, these fill in an interesting niche between [Predator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-1_Predator)  and  [Global Hawk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk)  drones and traditional satellites. If these are used for rolling out internet service or environmental studies, that’s great. If they are used for perpetual surveillance, I’m less than psyched. I’m not sure how you separate the two.
