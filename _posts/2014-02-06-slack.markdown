 @herminghaus: @pmarca A grey area is white as long as you're considered good, black as soon as you're considered bad. It's time-division multiplexed grey. 

 @pmarca:  After the fact they all get painted as bad people -- but they generally viewed themselves as good people, as did many others, to start. 

 We all need slack. When you have slack things. 

 Like trust. When you have trust and people trust you, you get the benefit of the doubt. 

 Grey Area is like trust 

 Trust, slack, benefit of the doubt, all synonyms.
