 [Page Layers](http://www.pagelayers.com)  is a  [Mac App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/page-layers/id437835477?mt=12&affId=2211717&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)  that converts any webpage into a Photoshop file. It renders each page element to it’s own layer in Photoshop. I’m unclear on how it renders text, if it’s editable text (would be awesome) or just a rendered image of the text. Either way, this is a cool piece of tech and could be really useful.
