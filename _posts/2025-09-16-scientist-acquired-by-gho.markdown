23 years ago, I met Kevin Lustig and Andy Martin. In 2007—over 18 years ago—we founded Assay Depot, which has since grown into Scientist.com. From the very beginning, our vision was to make scientific research more efficient, transparent, and collaborative. What started as a small idea has become a platform trusted by the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and hundreds of biotech firms.

Today, I'm honored to share that Scientist.com has entered into an agreement to be acquired by [GHO Capital Partners LLP](https://ghocapital.com). GHO is the ideal partner to help us accelerate our mission, expand globally, and continue transforming the way outsourced research is done.

I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been part of this journey—Dan Kagan, Diana Rios Ourthiague, Rob Kaufman, our employees, whose dedication and talent made the impossible possible; our investors, who believed in us from the start; my cofounders, Kevin and Andy, with whom I've had the privilege of building this company for nearly two decades; and above all, my family. There are far too many people to name individually, but the constant love and encouragement of my wife, Dana, and our family have made everything we've achieved possible.

This milestone is both a celebration of how far we've come and the beginning of an exciting new chapter. The future for Scientist.com is bright, and I couldn't be more hopeful about what's ahead.
