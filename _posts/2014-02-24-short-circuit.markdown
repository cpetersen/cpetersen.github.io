Engineers, when talking to Engineers, should and do usually answer questions beginning with "it depends”. This is because solutions depend on context and that context informs how the product can and should develop. 

 Often when “business people” or non-engineers hear this “it depends” they see it and use at a wedge to make a sale. This is the wrong way to use the space that “it depends” creates. That space should be used to better the product, to understand the trade offs being made and help the user navigate them. This makes the product better, which should lead to more sales. 

 When you use “it depends” to make a sale or let your customer define your product, you short circuit this mechanism. Like any short circuit, it means somethings not functioning properly and if it goes on too long, your product will likely suffer permanent damage.
