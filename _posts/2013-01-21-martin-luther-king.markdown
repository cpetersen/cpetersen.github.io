"A good trouble. A necessary trouble." Seems like an appropriate way to remember Dr King.

He told PBS NewsHour, “King inspired me and thousands of other Americans to get in the way. He inspired us to get in trouble. But it was good trouble; it was necessary trouble. And that’s why we honor Martin Luther King, Jr. today.”
