This is somewhat expected—the sort of people that start companiesgenerally like doing new things, not executing relentlessly on the samethings.  But restraint is critical.  It’s very easy to justify taking on one moreproject by saying that it won’t be that time consuming.  Unfortunately, it will likely either be time consuming, or it won’tbe worth anything.  Most founders knowwhat to do; they just don’t know what not to do.
