 >  It's a matter of motive. To a criminal, all files of credit card numbers are equally good, so your security depends in part on how much better or worse you are than those around you. If the attacker wants you specifically -- as in the examples above -- relative security is irrelevant. What matters is whether or not your security is better than the attackers' skill. And so often it's not. 

  [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com)  on the poor state of software (and personal) information security.
