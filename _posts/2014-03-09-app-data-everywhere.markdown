 [@leahculver](https://twitter.com/leahculver) ’s SXSW talk on the Dropbox API and data synchronization. I’ve been thinking a lot about the Dropbox API lately, I think my next fun project will use it.  

 It looks like their mobile SDKs are oauth v1 while their Java and Ruby SDKs are oauth v2, I think I need to dig in a little more.
