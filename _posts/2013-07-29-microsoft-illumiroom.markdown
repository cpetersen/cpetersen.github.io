This is pretty cool. Microsoft uses a projector to project a virtual environment around your TV. So when you play a videogame, in addition to the detailed image on the screen, you get a less detailed peripheral image. This could really enhance driving games and first person shooters where you really notice the lack of peripheral vision.
