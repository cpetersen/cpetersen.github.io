I've been excited about using  [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com)  and  [Pixate](http://www.pixate.com)  to build iOS apps for a while now.  [This gem](http://pixate.github.com/RubyMotion-Pixate/)  seems to be exactly what I've been looking for. It even supports  [SASS](http://sass-lang.com). 

 RubyMotion allows you to build fully functional iOS apps in Ruby. 

 Pixate allows you to style iOS apps using CSS. (Techcrunch coverage of their launch  [here](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/pixate-debuts-a-framework-for-designing-mobile-apps-with-css/) ) 

 SASS is a CSS framework giving you variables, nesting, mixins and more. 

 This could be a very powerful toolchain.
