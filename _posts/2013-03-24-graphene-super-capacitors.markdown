We've all heard of super conductors, now scientists have discovered super capacitors.

Scientists have discovered that graphene can act as an extremely dense energy store and can be charged in seconds.

The video doesn't really describe how it works, but given our increased reliance on battery technology, this could be an important breakthrough.

 > As the video above explains, Kaner and El-Kady had stumbled upon an energy storage medium with revolutionary potential. Imagine filling your smart phone with a long-lasting charge in just a couple seconds, or an electric car in a minute. Future applications, [first described in a March 2012 issue of*Science*](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6074/1326) , looked *very* promising.
