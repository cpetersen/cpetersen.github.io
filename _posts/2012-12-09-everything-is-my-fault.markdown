Some philosophy from  [@sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers). Everything's my fault... and that's great!

 > 
 > 
 >  __This is way better than forgiving.__ When you forgive, you’re still playing the victim, and they’re still wrong, but you’re charitably pardoning their horrible deeds.
 > 
 > But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged. __They were just playing their part in the situation you created.__ They’re just delivering the punch-line to the joke you set up.
