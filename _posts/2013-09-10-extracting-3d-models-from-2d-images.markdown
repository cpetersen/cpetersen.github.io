Wow, just wow.  

 This software lets you quickly extract and manipulate 3D objects from 2D pictures. You need to define the cross section using two strokes, then the length with a third stroke. What you get is a fully textured 3D model and the software even fills in the background as you translate, rotate, scale or copy it. Amazing.
