 I'm not against April Fool's day, and to my knowledge, neither is Monty Hall. However, in honor of April Fool's day, I wanted to post something that is hard to believe, but is actually true. 

### The Monty Hall Problem

 The problem is based on the old game show, *Let's Make a Deal*. You are presented with 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car, behind the other two are goats. You pick a door. Monty Hall, then opens one of the doors that you didn't pick to reveal a goat and asks you if you'd like to keep your door or switch. 

### Do you stay or change?

 Most people think, myself included, that there are now two doors, my odds are 50/50, so why switch? It turns out, that's not true, you're odds double if you switch. It's 2 to 1 that the car is behind the other door. 

 Simply put, when you chose your first door, there is a 1/3 chance of the car being behind it. In other words, there's 2/3's chance it is behind another door. When Monty Hall opens one of those doors to reveal a goat, that 2/3 chance is no longer split between two doors and is transferred to the remaining door. So your original door stays at 1/3 chance, the other closed door has a 2/3 chance. So your best bet is to switch doors. 

 Sound impossible? Business Insider  [explains the math](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-monty-hall-problem-2013-3?op=1)  here and Wikipedia  [confirms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

 It sounds crazy, but it's true! Happy April Fools!
