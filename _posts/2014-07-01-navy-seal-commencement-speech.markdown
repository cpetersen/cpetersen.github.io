A former Navy Seal gives the University of Texas class of 2014 life lessons from seal training. According to Admiral McRaven, if you want to change the world, you must: 

 * Make your bed
 * Find someone to help you paddle
 * Measure a person by the size of their heart, not by the size of their flippers
 * Get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward
 * Don't be afraid of the circuses
 * Sometimes you have to slide down the obstacles head first
 * Don't back down from the sharks
 * You must be your very best in the darkest moments
 * Start singing when you're up to your neck in mud
 * Don't ever, ever ring the bell

 They make more sense if you watch the video.
