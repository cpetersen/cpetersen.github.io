Well, fascinating might be a bit of an overstatement. The Atlantic has chosen  [the 11 most interesting charts](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/the-12-most-fascinating-charts-from-mary-meekers-epic-slideshow-of-internet-trends/276350/)  from Mary Meeker's presentation about internet trends. Nothing earth shattering here, but it's interesting to see it all distilled into 11 charts.
