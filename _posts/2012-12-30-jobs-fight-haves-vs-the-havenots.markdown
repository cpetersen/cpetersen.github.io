Marc Andreesen makes the case that the middle class is disappearing and that programmers (engineers in general actually) will rule the world. On the other hand, that is what you would expect a programmer/investor to say.

 > "The spread of computers and the Internet will put jobs in two categories," Andreessen says. "People who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do."
