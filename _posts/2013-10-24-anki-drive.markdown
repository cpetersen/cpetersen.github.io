Remember  [these](http://anki.com/ankidrive)  from the Apple keynote? Well, these little autonomous or controllable cars are now  [available](http://store.apple.com/us/search/anki).   They look like a live-action video game. In a sense these are little drones, they are obviously frivolous (but really neat). I wonder if we'll see more of these cheap single purpose personal drones in the future.
