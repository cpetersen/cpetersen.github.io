 [Ratchet](http://maker.github.com/ratchet/)  is an interesting project. I'm glad people who want to prototype iOS apps have a  [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)  like framework to do so. However, I still prefer  [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com)  and something like  [Pixate](http://www.pixate.com)  for rapidly prototyping mobile apps.
