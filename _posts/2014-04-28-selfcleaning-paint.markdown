 Nissan is introducing a “self cleaning paint” so your car never (or rarely) needs to be washed. It’s a super hydrophobic and oleophobic material that repels both water and oil. 

 I remember seeing a youtube video about super hydrophobic coatings a few years ago. It was used to protect phones and computers etc. Between this and  [Rust-Oleum’s NeverWet](http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/neverwet/neverwet-kit) , I’m glad to see some products finally coming to market.
