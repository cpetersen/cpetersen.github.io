I've heard of BitTorrent Sync, but I had no idea it was that popular. I really want to try it, but for me, it can't be a DropBox "killer" until there are mobile apps for it.

That being said, I'm intrigued by the idea of a BitTorrent Sync mobile app that connects to a web service that's running on one of my machines.
